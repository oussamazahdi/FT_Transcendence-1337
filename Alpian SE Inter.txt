✅ High-Level Matchmaking Logic
The idea:

A player clicks "Find Match" in Next.js.

The backend (Fastify) adds the player to a matchmaking queue.

When there are 2 players, they get matched into a game room.

Backend notifies both players → “You are matched”.

Both players join a WebSocket game room.

The game starts.
